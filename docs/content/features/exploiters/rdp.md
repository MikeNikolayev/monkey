## RDP

[RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)](
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/termserv/remote-desktop-protocol)
is a network communication protocol by Microsoft which enables users to connect
to another computer over a network, providing a remote display and input
capabilities to the user. It is commonly used for remote administration, remote
technical support, and remote work access.

## Exploitation

Machines with RDP enabled may be accessible to attackers if
they come across the correct credentials.

Infection Monkey's RDP exploiter uses brute-force to attempt to
propagate to a victim via RDP.

### Credentials used

The RDP exploiter will use [user-configured credentials](
/usage/configuration/credentials) as well as LM or NT hashes collected from
other victims. Different combinations of credentials are attempted in the
following order:

1. **Brute force usernames and passwords** - The exploiter will attempt to use
   all combinations of usernames and passwords that were set in the
   [configuration](/usage/configuration/credentials) or collected from other
   victims.

1. **Brute force usernames and NT hashes** - The exploiter will attempt to use
   all combinations of usernames and NT Hashes that were set in the
   [configuration](/usage/configuration/credentials) or collected from other
   victims.

   This only works on Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2. You can read more
   [here](https://www.kali.org/blog/passing-hash-remote-desktop/).

## Mitigation

1. Change user passwords to complex passwords that are not shared with other
computers on the network.
