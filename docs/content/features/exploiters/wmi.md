## WMI

[WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)](
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page) is a set
of tools and extensions in Windows for managing and querying system information,
configurations, and operations. WMI's command line utilities and scripting
capabilities are used by administrators to run arbitrary commands on local and
remote environments for monitoring system health, automating administrative
functions, managing network resources, etc.

## Exploitation

Attackers that can successfully authenticate to a machine via WMI can run
arbitrary commands on the victim machine. This allows the attacker to perform
actions such as installing malware, exfiltrating data, or pivoting and moving
laterally through the network. Infection Monkey's WMI exploiter uses
brute-force to attempt to propagate to a victim via WMI.

### Credentials used

The WMI exploiter uses [user-configured credentials](
/usage/configuration/credentials) as well as credentials collected from other
victims for brute-forcing. All possible combinations of usernames, passwords,
LM hashes, and NT hashes are used, prioritizing pairs provided by the user in
the configuration.

## Mitigation

Change user passwords to complex passwords that are not shared with other
computers on the network.
