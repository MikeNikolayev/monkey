## WMI

[WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation)](
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmi-start-page) is a set
of tools and extensions in Windows for managing and querying system information,
configurations, and operations. WMI's command line utilities and scripting
capabilities are used by administrators to run arbitrary commands on local and
remote environments for monitoring system health, automating administrative
functions, managing network resources, etc.

## Exploitation

Machines with WMI enabled may be accessible to attackers if they come across the
correct credentials. Infection Monkey's WMI exploiter uses brute-force to
attempt to propagate to a victim via WMI.

### Credentials used

The WMI exploiter uses [user-configured credentials](
/usage/configuration/credentials) as well as credentials collected from other
victims for brute-forcing. All possible combinations of usernames, passwords,
LM hashes, and NT hashes are used, prioritizing pairs provided by the user in
the configuration.

## Mitigation

Change user passwords to complex passwords that are not shared with other
computers on the network.
