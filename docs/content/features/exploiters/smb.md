## SMB

[SMB (Server Message Block)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block)
is a network protocol primarily used in Windows for sharing and communication
between computers on a network. Besides resource sharing, SMB supports remote
procedure calls (RPC), which allows executing arbitrary commands on remote
systems using command line utilities such as `psexec` and `smbexec`. This is
generally used for administrative tasks and remote management.

## Exploitation

Machines with SMB enabled may be accessible to attackers if they come across the
correct credentials. Infection Monkey's SMB exploiter uses brute-force to
attempt to propagate to a victim via SMB.

### Credentials used

The SMB exploiter uses [user-configured credentials](
/usage/configuration/credentials) as well as credentials collected from other
victims for brute-forcing. All possible combinations of usernames, passwords,
LM hashes, and NT hashes are used, prioritizing pairs provided by the user in
the configuration.

## Mitigation

Change user passwords to complex passwords that are not shared with other
computers on the network.
