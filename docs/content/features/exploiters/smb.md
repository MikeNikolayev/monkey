## SMB

[SMB (Server Message Block)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block)
is a network protocol primarily used in Windows for inter-process communication,
and providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports between nodes
on a network.

## Exploitation

Machines with SMB enabled may be accessible to attackers if
they come across the correct credentials.

Infection Monkey's SMB exploiter uses brute-force to attempt to
propagate to a victim via SMB.

### Credentials used

The SMB exploiter will use [user-configured credentials](
/usage/configuration/credentials) as well as credentials collected from other
victims for brute-forcing. All possible combinations of usernames, passwords,
LM hashes, and NT hashes are used, prioritizing pairs provided by the user in
the configuration.

## Mitigation

1. Change user passwords to complex passwords that are not shared with other
computers on the network.
