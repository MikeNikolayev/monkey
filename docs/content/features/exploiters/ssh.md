## SSH

[SSH (Secure Shell)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) is a network
protocol designed for Unix-like operating systems that provides a secure way to
access a remote computer over an unsecured network.

## Exploitation

Machines with SSH enabled may be accessible to attackers if
they come across the correct credentials.

Infection Monkey's SSH exploiter uses brute-force to attempt to
propagate to a victim via SSH.

### Credentials used

The SSH exploiter will use [user-configured credentials](
/usage/configuration/credentials) as well as credentials collected from other
victims for brute-forcing. All possible combinations of usernames, passwords,
and SSH keypairs are used, prioritizing pairs provided by the user in the
configuration.

## Mitigation

1. Change user passwords to complex passwords that are not shared with other
computers on the network.

1. [Store private keys securely.](
